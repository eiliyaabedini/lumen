# Security model

Lumen ships as a public-facing learning platform. This document is the
authoritative map of every control that protects the service in
production — `CLAUDE.md` is the short-form orientation, this file is
the long form. Updated for Phase H6 (production hardening, May 2026).

## Auth model at a glance

| Client kind | Access token transport | Refresh token transport |
|-------------|------------------------|--------------------------|
| Browser (SPA) | `__Host-access` cookie (`Secure`, `HttpOnly`, `SameSite=Strict`) in prod; `access` cookie in dev | `__Host-refresh` cookie / `refresh` cookie in dev |
| API client (CLI / mobile / server-to-server) | `Authorization: Bearer <jwt>` | `Authorization: Bearer` against `/auth/refresh` with the refresh token in the body — or the cookie if the client persists it |
| WebSocket (chat, notifications) | `?token=<jwt>` query param (browsers can't set headers on WS handshakes) | Refresh out-of-band via the HTTP API; the WS upgrade itself never carries a refresh token |

Token lifetimes:

* **Access JWT** — 15 minutes, HS256 signed with `JWT_SECRET`, issuer
  `lumen`, `sub = user_id`, `role` claim. The JWT is opaque to the
  frontend; it round-trips back to the API on every authenticated call.
* **Refresh** — 14 days, opaque random 48-byte URL-safe string,
  SHA-256-hashed at rest. Rotates on every use; the previous value is
  marked `revoked_at` with a `replaced_by_id` pointer.

## Threat model (STRIDE summary)

| Threat | Mitigation |
|--------|-----------|
| Spoofing | Argon2id passwords, JWT signed (HS256, rotating signing key planned), refresh rotation with reuse detection |
| Tampering | Pydantic validation at the edge; ORM bound parameters; signed cookies; HSTS |
| Repudiation | Audit log for admin actions and security-sensitive operations |
| Information disclosure | RBAC at dependency layer; PII redaction in logs; HTTPS only; SSO cookies `__Host-` prefixed |
| Denial of service | slowapi rate limits, request body size cap, async I/O, query timeouts, queue depth alarms |
| Elevation of privilege | Roles checked in service layer, not just routes; admin endpoints require step-up auth (re-enter password within 5 min) |

## Controls

### Transport
- TLS 1.3 only (Caddy); HSTS preload-ready (`max-age=63072000; includeSubDomains; preload`).
- HTTP/2 + HTTP/3 enabled.

### Headers (Next.js + Caddy)
- `Content-Security-Policy` strict, with `nonce`-based scripts.
- `Strict-Transport-Security`, `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `X-Frame-Options: DENY`, `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`, `Permissions-Policy: camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=()`.
- CORS: allow-list of front-end origin only.

### Auth
- Password policy: min 12 chars, mixed character classes; HIBP k-anonymity check optional.
- Lockout: 5 failed logins → 15 min IP+account cooldown.
- **No login enumeration**: the authenticate path always runs one Argon2
  verification — against a real or a precomputed dummy hash — so the
  wire-time latency for "no such email" and "wrong password" is dominated
  by the same CPU work. Locked in by `tests/test_login_timing.py`.
- Refresh tokens single-use; reuse triggers full chain revocation. Active
  sessions are listed at `GET /api/v1/users/me/sessions`; users can revoke
  one (`DELETE /me/sessions/{id}`) or all (`DELETE /me/sessions`).
- **Refresh-reuse alarm (H6)**: every reuse-detection event also writes
  an in-app notification (kind `security.refresh_reuse`) to every active
  admin, with the affected user's email, the IP that presented the
  reused token, and the original token's issue / revoke timestamps in
  the `data` blob. The notification is best-effort — a write failure
  is logged but never breaks the auth path. Covered by
  `tests/test_refresh_reuse_alarm.py`.
- **Password change** (`POST /me/change-password`) requires the current
  password and revokes every refresh token to force re-auth everywhere.
- **Password reset** (`POST /auth/password-reset/request|confirm`) uses a
  stateless JWT bound to the user's current password hash, so each link is
  single-use and a successful reset invalidates outstanding links.
- **Email verification** (`POST /auth/verify/request|confirm`) uses a
  stateless JWT bound to the user's current email — changing the email
  invalidates outstanding tokens; replays are idempotent.
- Optional 2FA (TOTP) post-MVP — schema already supports it.

### Rate limiting
- `slowapi` is mounted as middleware with a Redis-backed bucket (memory in
  tests). Per-IP limits today:

  | Endpoint | Limit |
  |----------|-------|
  | `POST /api/v1/auth/login` | 10 / minute |
  | `POST /api/v1/auth/register` | 5 / minute |
  | `POST /api/v1/auth/password-reset/request` | 3 / minute |
  | `POST /api/v1/auth/verify/request` | 3 / minute |

- Over-limit responses use the standard error envelope with
  `code: "rate_limited"` and carry a `Retry-After: 60` header.
- Reverse proxy `X-Forwarded-For` is trusted for the key; operators behind
  a load balancer that doesn't set XFF should adjust the proxy config.
- **429 metrics (H6)**: every 429 is recorded into an in-memory ring
  buffer (`app/core/rate_limit_metrics.py`); the admin endpoint
  `GET /api/v1/admin/rate-limit-stats?since=<epoch>` exposes
  `{endpoint: count}` so the H7 observability dashboard can show
  rate-limit pressure per route. The counter is process-local and
  resets on redeploy — when Lumen scales beyond one Fly machine the
  endpoint will switch to a Redis sorted-set without changing the
  response shape.

## LLM cost guard

LLM calls (RAG tutor, AI authoring, eval-as-judge) all route through
`app.services.llm` and are metered by H1 in the `llm_call_log` table:
prompt + completion token counts, model, latency, status, and the
cents-equivalent cost are persisted per call. Two related controls:

- **Daily / per-user cost cap** (H1) — once a learner hits the cap the
  next call returns a 429 with `code: "llm_budget_exceeded"`. The cap
  also defends against a curious visitor running a bad-actor loop
  against the public demo.
- **Provider abstraction** — the same metering powers swaps between
  Anthropic (paid), OpenAI (paid), and Groq Llama-3.3-70B (free tier;
  the v2 demo default — see `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-22-lumen-v2-agentic-positioning.md`
  §8).

The H6 production guard refuses to boot with `LLM_PROVIDER=noop` so a
demo that's accidentally pointed at the canned-text test provider
can't ship.

## AI Pass account connection

AI Pass is an optional OAuth account connection, not an API-key field.
FastAPI owns Authorization Code + PKCE S256, validates endpoints from the AI
Pass authorization-server metadata, and binds callbacks to both one-time state
and a short-lived HttpOnly browser nonce. The access token, refresh token, and
PKCE verifier are envelope-encrypted in Postgres; browser JavaScript receives
only connection status and live model metadata.

Refresh-token rotation holds a row lock and persists the replacement encrypted
bundle atomically. Disconnect serializes with refresh and callback completion,
invalidates pending connection attempts, attempts revocation, and always clears
local material. Tutor requests are the only dispatch surface that opts into AI
Pass; authoring and other existing provider paths remain unchanged. The worker
receives only an opaque connection ID, never a bearer token. A user cancellation
marks the durable turn aborted; the worker observes that state and cancels the
active upstream response so shared-wallet spend is not allowed to continue
after the UI stops. Disconnect cannot erase a queued job's AI Pass funding
marker; that job fails closed if its encrypted connection no longer exists.

The integration is fail-closed behind `FEATURE_AIPASS_OAUTH_ENABLED`. It also
requires a public OAuth client identifier from protected runtime
configuration, an exact registered HTTPS callback URI, and the production KEK.
The client identifier is not an API key or client secret, but its configured
value and all OAuth tokens stay out of source, logs, and application DTOs. See
[ADR-0032](adr/0032-aipass-oauth-account-connection.md).

## Production boot guards

In addition to `Settings.assert_production_ready()` (dev-default
detection), `app/core/prod_guards.py` runs a second pass at startup
when `ENV=production`. The guard refuses to boot if any of these are
true:

| Check | Hard / Soft | Why |
|-------|-------------|-----|
| `LLM_PROVIDER == "noop"` | hard | Ships a demo that silently returns canned text. |
| `len(SECRET_KEY) < 32` | hard | HS256 / RFC 7518 §3.2 floor — short keys are guessable. |
| `len(JWT_SECRET) < 32` | hard | Same rationale; JWT signing key. |
| `DATABASE_URL` contains `localhost` / `127.0.0.1` / `::1` / `0.0.0.0` | hard | Catches staging-misconfig-as-prod. |
| `CORS_ORIGINS` empties out after stripping loopback / `.test` | hard | Browsers couldn't reach the API. |
| `LLM_PROVIDER=openai` with the OpenAI default `OPENAI_API_BASE` | **soft warn** | Operator probably meant Groq's `/openai/v1`. |

Soft warnings route through `structlog` at startup so the operator
sees them even when the boot succeeds.

### Data
- PII columns marked in models; logging filter redacts emails by default.
- GDPR endpoints: `GET /api/v1/users/me/export` and `DELETE /api/v1/users/me`
  (password required; scrambles PII, deactivates the account, revokes all
  refresh tokens).
- Public **certificate verification** at `GET /api/v1/certificates/verify/{id}`
  intentionally returns only the learner's *display name* and the course
  metadata — never the email or any other PII.
- Backups encrypted at rest (operator-provided).

### Application
- Output encoding by React; Markdown rendered through a sanitizer (`DOMPurify`).
- File uploads constrained by MIME + magic bytes server-side; max size enforced; AV scan hook (ClamAV image optional).
- Object storage uses presigned URLs with short TTL; bucket is private.
- Idempotency keys retained for 24 h to prevent double-submit replay attacks.

### Secrets
- Never in repo; `.env` is git-ignored; production secrets via the operator's secret store.
- `gitleaks` runs on pre-commit and CI.
- Signing keys rotated every 90 d (planned; manual via `make rotate-jwt`).
- **Startup guard**: `Settings.assert_production_ready()` refuses to boot
  when `ENV=production` if `SECRET_KEY`, `JWT_SECRET`, or
  `S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` are still the dev defaults, or if `CORS_ORIGINS`
  contains `localhost`. Covered by `tests/test_config_guard.py`.
- **Secret rotation procedure**:
  1. Generate the new value: `python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(48))"`.
  2. Update the secret in the operator's secret store (Fly secrets,
     Vercel project env, GitHub Actions, …).
  3. Trigger a rolling redeploy. The API picks up the new value via
     `get_settings()` at process start.
  4. For `JWT_SECRET` specifically: every in-flight access token signed
     with the old secret becomes invalid immediately. Browsers refresh
     transparently against their (cookie-stored) refresh token; CLI /
     server-to-server clients must re-authenticate. This is the
     intended blast radius for a rotation — anything else would mean
     the old key is still trusted somewhere.

### CORS policy

Allow-list driven by `CORS_ORIGINS`. The H6 boot filter strips
loopback / `.test` entries in production so a stray dev origin can't
slip through into a live deploy. If the filtered list is empty the
boot fails hard with `Production CORS_ORIGINS must include at least
one non-loopback origin`. `allow_credentials=True` so cookie-authed
mutations from the frontend work; the `CSRFOriginMiddleware` further
checks the `Origin` header against the same allow-list for any cookie-
authenticated mutating method.

### Dependencies
- Renovate weekly; Dependabot security alerts.
- Trivy scans built images; SBOMs (CycloneDX) per release.

### Logging
- JSON structured; no full request bodies; no Authorization headers; emails redacted.
- Request IDs propagated; PII fields explicitly excluded from logging filter.

## Threat model (one-page summary)

A focused recap of the STRIDE table above, scoped to the v2 single-VM
public demo (AWS t4g.small per [`docs/deployment/aws-vps.md`](deployment/aws-vps.md);
free LLM tier via Groq's OpenAI-compatible endpoint).

**Assets.** Learner accounts (email + Argon2id hash + course progress
+ certificate VCs); instructor course drafts; admin observability /
audit log; LLM API keys; the signing keys (`SECRET_KEY`, `JWT_SECRET`,
`BADGES_SIGNING_KEY`); object-storage assets (course media, learner
uploads).

**Adversaries.**

| Adversary | Plausible goals | In-scope mitigations |
|-----------|----------------|----------------------|
| Curious visitor (anonymous) | Probe for endpoints, fingerprint stack, cheap LLM cost-burn | Anon rate limits, login-timing flattening, no `Server` header, LLM cost guard, public certificate verifier returns no PII |
| Malicious learner (authenticated) | Privilege escalation to instructor / admin, scrape other learners' data, abuse the AI tutor, replay refresh tokens | Roles enforced in services (not just routes), refresh-reuse → chain revocation + admin alarm, per-user rate limits, idempotency keys, GDPR scoping (`/users/me/*` only reads own data) |
| Malicious instructor | Tamper with other instructors' courses, inject XSS through course content, exfiltrate learner reviews | RBAC at the service layer, ownership checks per resource, Markdown sanitised via DOMPurify on the client + safe rendering on the server, course-scoped reviews |
| Compromised API key (LLM / S3 / SMTP) | Cost burn, message tampering, content tampering | Cost cap (H1), short-TTL presigned URLs, distinct keys per environment, secret rotation procedure above, audit log records every admin action |

**Out of scope.**

* **DDoS at the network layer** — Cloudflare / Fly handle L3/L4; the
  app's rate limiter is application-layer only.
* **Supply-chain attacks** — Renovate + Dependabot + Trivy on built
  images + `gitleaks` cover the practical surface; full SBOM
  attestation lives with the host.
* **State-actor adversaries** — out of scope for a learning platform.
