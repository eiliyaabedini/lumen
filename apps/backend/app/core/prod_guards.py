"""Production boot guards (Phase H6).

These checks complement :meth:`app.core.config.Settings.assert_production_ready`
by catching footguns specific to the public demo deploy: shipping with the
``noop`` LLM provider, secrets shorter than 32 chars (HS256 / RFC 7518 §3.2),
or a stray ``DATABASE_URL`` pointing at a localhost Postgres.

They live in their own module so the assertions can be exercised by unit
tests without spinning up the FastAPI app — the existing ``test_config_guard``
tests Settings-level invariants; ``test_prod_guards`` tests these.

Conventions:

* ``check_production_ready(settings)`` raises ``RuntimeError`` with a
  joined human-readable message listing every problem found, so an
  operator sees the full set in one pass rather than fixing-and-rebooting.
* Soft signals (e.g. ``OPENAI_API_BASE`` unset while ``LLM_PROVIDER=openai``)
  return as a separate list of warnings; the caller logs them but the
  boot proceeds.
