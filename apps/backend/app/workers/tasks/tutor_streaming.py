"""Celery task that runs a tutor turn end-to-end (L21a → L32).

Per ADR-0017/0019:

- ``bind=True`` + ``max_retries=0`` + ``acks_late=True``. We don't
  want auto-retry on a soft failure because each retry burns LLM
  cost; the sweep beat marks the row failed and the client's poll
  loop sees a clean error.
- Atomic phase fence via ``claim_pending_turn`` — only one worker
  proceeds.
- ``asyncio.run()`` inside the sync task wraps the async
  orchestrator (ADR-0017).
- ``finally`` block wraps every cleanup in ``contextlib.suppress``
  so a Redis flake doesn't skip the next cleanup step (plan-v7
  §V7-F7).

L32 — pgvector retrieval runs HERE (not inside orchestrate_stream)
so the orchestrator stays a pure async generator with no DB session.
After the phase-fence we resolve the course row + run the retriever
sub-agent + then pass the chunks to ``orchestrate_stream``.
