"""Streaming tutor endpoints (L21a).

Four endpoints + one shared schema:

- ``POST   /api/v1/tutor/turns``        — open a new streaming turn.
- ``GET    /api/v1/tutor/turns/{tid}/status`` — poll terminal state.
- ``GET    /api/v1/tutor/turns/{tid}/stream`` — SSE event source.
- ``DELETE /api/v1/tutor/turns/{tid}``   — cancel.

ALL four are gated on ``settings.feature_tutor_streaming``. While the
flag is OFF (the L21a-shipped default), every endpoint returns 503
``tutor.streaming_disabled``. L21b's flag-flip turns them on; until
then the existing /tutor/conversations/* path stays canonical.

The SSE event wire shape matches what
``services/tutor_orchestrator_stream.py::orchestrate_stream`` yields —
see that module for the event catalogue.
