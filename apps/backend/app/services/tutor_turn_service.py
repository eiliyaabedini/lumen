"""TutorTurnJob lifecycle service (L21a).

Wraps the DB row that ADR-0019 introduced. Three responsibilities:

1. **Create a turn** at POST time — inserts a `pending` row with
   reservation metadata + the prompt-template hash + an enqueue side-
   effect that fires after `commit()`.
2. **Atomic phase fence** — the Celery task's first action; UPDATE
   ... WHERE status='pending' RETURNING id, returning either the
   row (we own it) or None (another worker beat us).
3. **Terminal transitions** — `mark_complete`, `mark_failed`,
   `mark_aborted` — each zeros `reserved_cost_usd` so the sweep
   doesn't double-release.

The actual Redis Streams emit lives in `app/services/redis_streams.py`
and the Celery task itself in `app/workers/tasks/tutor_streaming.py`.
This module is pure DB.
