"""Cost-tracked LLM call wrapper — Phase H1.

Single entrypoint every metered LLM call goes through. Responsibilities:

1. **Budget guard.** Before invoking the provider, sum
   ``llm_calls.cost_usd`` for the caller (excluding the
   ``__system__`` sentinel — that bucket has its own, separate
   limit conceptually, and we don't want the eval suite's traffic
   to throttle a learner). If the rolling-24h sum is already over
   ``settings.llm_user_budget_24h_usd``, persist a
   ``status="budget_exceeded"`` row and raise
   :class:`~app.core.errors.BudgetExceededError` — the caller
   surfaces a friendly 429 to the client.
2. **Latency timing.** Wall-clock the call so the persisted
   ``latency_ms`` is the user-visible round-trip, not the
   downstream model's reported inference time. This is the
   cheapest "is the upstream slow?" signal we have.
3. **Cost computation.** Hand ``model + tokens`` to
   :func:`app.services.llm_pricing.compute_cost_usd`. Unknown
   models log a warning and persist ``cost_usd=0``.
4. **Error capture.** Any exception from the provider is caught,
   a row is persisted with ``status="error"`` + ``error_kind`` set
   to the exception class name, then the exception is re-raised
   unchanged. Callers see the same error they always have; the
   admin gets a forensic trail.
5. **Commit isolation.** Persisting the meter row uses a
   short-lived nested transaction (``session.begin_nested()``) so a
   commit failure on the meter doesn't roll back the caller's
   work. If we can't write the meter row, we log and move on —
   refusing to serve the request because we couldn't record it
   would be the wrong trade-off.

Disable switch. When ``settings.llm_cost_tracking_enabled`` is
``False``, the wrapper degenerates to a pass-through call: no
budget check, no row written, no extra DB I/O. Useful for synthetic
load tests and the rare case where we want to bypass the meter
during a migration.

    and the admin ``billing_mode`` rollup. The worker calls this at the
    terminal transition.

    S7 token plumbing: ``prompt_tokens`` / ``completion_tokens`` now carry the
    provider's reported usage from the stream's terminal ``turn_complete``
    event (OpenAI/Groq via ``stream_options={"include_usage": true}`` on the
    final chunk; Anthropic via ``get_final_message().usage``; Noop synthesises
    zero). They default to 0 so a failure/abort that never received a usage
    chunk records honest zeros — the provider billed nothing observable, so we
    claim nothing.

    QUOTA INVARIANT (do not silently change): streaming request windows stay
    COUNT-based (``user_request_count`` over ``llm_calls`` rows), NOT
    token-based. These token columns are recorded for cost/observability only.
    A future refactor that wires streaming quota off ``prompt_tokens`` /
    ``completion_tokens`` would break the count-based contract pinned by
    ``test_streamed_turn_tokens_are_observability_only`` — change the test
    deliberately if that is ever the intent.

    ``feature`` (streamed-trace-depth fix): the learner trace drill-down
    filters ``llm_calls`` by the ``tutor.multi_agent`` prefix, so the
    worker's SUCCESS path passes ``"tutor.multi_agent.synth"`` — the
    ``.synth`` suffix makes the row the drill-down's main call and feeds
    AGENT RUN TOTALS. Failure/abort paths keep the default
    ``"tutor.stream"`` so a failed attempt never pollutes a successful
    turn's totals. The request quota is COUNT-based over ALL rows
    regardless of feature (``_user_request_count`` has no feature
    filter), so this changes nothing about quota math.
