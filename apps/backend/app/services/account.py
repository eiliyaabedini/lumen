"""Account lifecycle service: self-serve deletion + cooperative cancellation.

ADR-0030. Self-serve ``DELETE /me`` is **anonymize-in-place**: we never call
``session.delete(user)``. The ``users`` row persists forever as an anonymized
tombstone; every FK graph stays intact (lineage, audit, cost integrity); PII is
irreversibly scrubbed. Suspension (admin) shares ``is_active`` but is reversible
— the single discriminator is ``deleted_at IS NULL``.

The choreography (D2) runs inside the request's single transaction so any
failure rolls everything back — no half-tombstone. The **core** PII scrub +
deactivate is un-guarded (must succeed); only the optional sibling-table steps
are narrowly try-guarded (catch only ``ProgrammingError``/``UndefinedTable``)
so a not-yet-landed sibling *table* never blocks the core scrub (open-risk 1).

F1 (S6 gate): ``ImportError`` was REMOVED from the guarded set. Its only purpose
was tolerance for not-yet-built *model modules*; every model this module touches
exists today and is imported at module top, so a wrong class name now fails
loudly at import time rather than being silently swallowed at call time (the
``McpClient``/``MCPClient`` typo that left MCP clients un-revoked on deletion).
When S3 lands a new model it adds its own guard alongside its own import.
